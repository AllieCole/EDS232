```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load libraries
librarian::shelf(
  devtools,
  keras,
  reticulate,
  tensorflow)

# show library versions and paths
session_info() 

# install Python into user space
(reticulate::miniconda_path()) # show the Python path
if (!file.exists(reticulate::miniconda_path()))
  reticulate::install_miniconda()

# install keras with tensorflow
if (!keras::is_keras_available())
  keras::install_keras()
```

Next, tell RStudio to use this version of Python by default. Go to Tools > Global Options > Python and Select… to navigate to the option ~/.local/share/r-miniconda/bin/python. You’ll need to Apply and it should ask you to restart your session, which you’ll need to accept.
